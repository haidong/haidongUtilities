Place where Haidong stores his utility scripts:

1. backupBlog.sh
This script does two things: a. it rsyncs the public_html folder on the remote host so you have a local copy; b. it makes a MySQL db backup on the remote host, zip it, and then copy it to the local machine. It makes sure that the database backup is removed after all is done so the backup files do not pile up. It also removes db backup files that are older than 5 days. Make sure id_rsa.pub is copied to the remote host
